\pard\s1 3. Introduction\par
\pard\s2 Background and Problem Domain\par
\pard\s0 Traditional learning environments face challenges such as limited accessibility, inconsistent content delivery, and lack of engagement. An E-Learning Management System (LMS) provides a digital platform to manage, deliver, and track educational content online effectively.\par
\pard\s2 Significance of the Project\par
\pard\s0 This project is important as it enables flexible, accessible, and scalable learning opportunities, enhancing educational outcomes and supporting remote and blended learning models.\par
\pard\s2 Stakeholders\par
\pard\s0 Learners, educators, administrators, educational institutions, corporate trainers, and technical support teams.\par

\pard\s1 4. Problem Statement\par
\pard\s2 Clear Statement of the Problem\par
\pard\s0 There is a need for a robust, scalable learning management system that supports diverse learning models, content types, and provides comprehensive user and course management to improve the learning experience and streamline administration.\par
\pard\s2 Current Limitations of Existing Systems\par
\pard\s0 Many existing systems lack support for blended learning, insufficient content authoring tools, limited integration capabilities, and inadequate user management features.\par

\pard\s1 5. System Description\par
\pard\s2 System Environment\par
\pard\s0 Web-based platform accessible via desktop and mobile devices, supporting cloud hosting for scalability.\par
\pard\s2 Major Features\par
\pard\s0 - User and course management\par
- Content authoring and management\par
- Automated enrollment and notifications\par
- Diverse learning models (self-paced, instructor-led, blended)\par
- Assessment and certification\par
- Reporting and analytics\par
- Integration with third-party tools (e.g., video conferencing, HR systems)\par
\pard\s2 Use Cases/User Stories\par
\pard\s0 - As a learner, I want to access courses and track my progress.\par
- As an instructor, I want to create and manage courses and assessments.\par
- As an administrator, I want to enroll users and generate reports.\par
\pard\s2 System Architecture (High-Level)\par
\pard\s0 Includes a client interface (web/mobile), application server with LMS logic, database for user and content storage, and integration APIs.\par
